//Create a program in Visual Studio or IntelliJ  that does the following:
//start off by writing out examples of what the program should do \
// in example you can shorten the number of scores and students.
//use these example to get an idea of how the code should be structured

1.) asks the user for a name 
2.) asks the user for 40 assignment scores
3.) repeats steps 1 and 2 100 times

4.) ask the user to enter a name.
5.) Figure out what scores correspond to that name.
6.) calculate that student's average score (total divided by 40)
7.) print out the average score 
8.) should go back to step 4 to allow user to continue to enter more names
