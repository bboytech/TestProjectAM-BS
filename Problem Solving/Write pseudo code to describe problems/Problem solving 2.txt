General Statement:
Output a given word horizontally and multiple times vertically so that each letter in the horizontal word matches the position of that letter vertically.

Input: 
a word

	// Use ToCharArray to convert string to array.
	char[] array = value.ToCharArray();

	// Loop through array.
	for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
	{
	    // Get character from array.
	    char letter = array[i];
	    // Display each letter.
	    Console.Write("Letter: ");
	    Console.WriteLine(letter);
	}
    }
