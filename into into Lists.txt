//declare a list  of integers called intList
//declare a list of doubles  called dblList
//declare a list of strings  called strList
//declare a list of bools called boolList

//add the following elements to intList : 1,2,3,4,5
//add the following elements to dblList: 123.4,43.4,12.4,65.7
//add the following elements to strList: "What", " did one"," ocean"," say to"," the  other?"

//set element 0 of intList to be 13
//set element 1 of intList to be 8
//set element 2 of intList to be 9
//set element 3 of intList to be 7
//set element 4 of intList to be 6

//set the first element (element 0)of dblList to be 13
//set the second element (element 1)of dblList to be 17.7
//set the fourth element (element 3)of dblList to be 21.512

//print out all of the values of intList  - for the printing reccommend using loops 
//print out all of the values of dblList  - also might want to put into function
//print out all of the values of strList

//set the fourth element (element 3)of strList to be " just"

//set the fifth element  (element 4)of strList to be " waved."
//set the third element  (element 2)of strList to be " it"
//set the first element  (element 0)of strList to be "Nothing"

//add the following elements to intList 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
//add the following elements to dblList 12,2.3,5.43

//print out the number of elements in intList
//print out the number of elements in dblList
//print out the number of elements in strList

//print out all of the values of intList  - for the printing reccommend using loops 
//print out all of the values of dblList  - also might want to put into a function
//print out all of the values of strList

//set the fourth element (element 3)of strList to be " when he"
